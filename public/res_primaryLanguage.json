      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Rocio Martinez and I most recently worked as a biomedical technician in the Army. I left after completing my contract and I wanted to take advantage of the educational benefits. In the hospitals, medical equipment is mixing with technology so I thought it was important for me to be educated on both topics. In the future I hope to work on advanced medical systems like MRI and x-ray units. I have a Top Secret Security Clearance and an advanced certification in Radiographic/Fluoroscopic Imaging Systems, but my biggest asset is a solution seeking, critical thinking approach to any problem. ðŸ’œ",
